// You need to calculate if it is possible to fuel up a spaceship within the number of seconds allowed(t),

// The maximum amount of litres per second (r) is constantly pumped into the tank until it is full.

// Line 1: An string "yes" or "no". "yes" if it is possible to fill up the spaceship in the time allowed,
//  "no" if it is not possible.
